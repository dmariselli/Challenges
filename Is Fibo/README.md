# Problem Statement

You are given an integer, N. Write a program to determine if N is an element of the Fibonacci Sequence.

The first few elements of fibonacci sequence are 0,1,1,2,3,5,8,13,... A fibonacci sequence is one where every element is a sum of the previous two elements in the sequence. The first two elements are 0 and 1.

# Input Format 
The first line contains T, number of test cases. 
T lines follows. Each line contains an integer N.

# Output Format 
Display IsFibo if N is a fibonacci number and IsNotFibo if it is not a fibonacci number. The output for each test case should be displayed in a new line.

# Constraints 
1<=T<=10^5 
1<=N<=10^10
